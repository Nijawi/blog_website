<p>Whether its making a simple site map or running deep learning analyses on satellite data, students and researchers are often called upon to conduct geospatial analysis. 🗺</p>
<p>Fortunately, there a wealth of freely available tools can help to complete these tasks: think R, Python and QGIS.🔨</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a steep learning curve is often required to apply these tools, particularly when we don’t all have a strong background in coding, GIS or remote sensing.</p>
<p>The UQ Geospatial Analysis Community of Practice (sometimes UQGAC, sometimes UQGEO) tries to make this process a bit less painful, by sharing our experiences, skills and tricks in a friendly and inclusive environment.</p>
<p>👩‍💻 We run monthly skill sharing tutorial sessions where a member of the community teaches us something they have learned along the way.</p>
<p>This usually occurs on the last Thursday of each month.<br />
See <a href="/upcoming-events/">upcoming events</a> for the next session.</p>
<p>And check out our <a href="/post/">blog</a> for previous sessions.</p>
