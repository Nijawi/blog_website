# Cloud computing with Open Data Cube and Python 

<br>


In this session, you will learn how to import, analyse and visualise satellite data using [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/),  one of the big geospatial cloud-computing platforms. We will be using Python code in Jupyter notebooks to run the commands.
