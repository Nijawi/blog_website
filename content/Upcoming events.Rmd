Christina is a quantitative ecologist at Griffith University interested in conserving blue forest ecosystems and informing climate-smart coastal restoration.


In this workshop, she will show us how to use R to read in spatial data and make beautiful interactive online maps. 

We will be using the following R packages: rshiny, shinydashboard, sf, mapdeck, leaflet, rmapshaper.
