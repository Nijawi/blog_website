This workshop will broadly cover remote sensing data analysis using the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) (ODC) developed by Geoscience Australia. We will go over some important Python packages that the ODC is built upon: ([Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/), [Dask](https://dask.org/)), and explore how they enable fast and scalable computation. A basic understanding of programming will be beneficial.

All the leaning material used in this tutorial is available on the Digital Earth Australia Sandbox as Jupyter Notebooks. <strong>An account will be required to participate</strong>, which can easily be created [here](https://app.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F), or you can just follow along with the demonstration. 

Additional documentation for the DEA Sandbox is available [here](https://docs.dea.ga.gov.au/index.html) which includes useful guides, a dataset catalogue and examples.
